# Naan Bread
Naan bread is a form of unleadved bread that is very popular in india. A proper naan bread should have a nicely browned and crispy exterior but fluffy interior. Some version of naan bread are stuffed with potatoes or cheese. Additionally, fully naan bread is usually brushed with melted butter and garnished with spicies and herbs. 

Traditionally, naan bread is made with a tandoori oven: a clay spherical oven that reaches temperatures of at least 800 F. Naan dough is stuck to the walls and left to cook. When it is done cooking, it is scrapped off and served. Because I do not have access to a tandoori oven, I will use a cast iron skillet to simulate the heat.

Something to test in regards to naan bread is whether or not to use yeast, baking soda, or baking powder. From my reading so far it appears yest will yield the best flavor, however it will take the longest. Baking powder and baking soda will have comparable lengths, however baking soda will add a peculiar taste to the bread since it is slightly basic. To counter act the taste created by baking soda, add in something acidic.
